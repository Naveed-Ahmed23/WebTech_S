    <!-- Part B: Paragraphs -->
    <p>My name is <strong>Naveed Ahmed</strong>. I am a student learning web development and building my portfolio step by step. This page demonstrates <em>basic HTML structure</em> and text formatting as part of my Lab Task 01.</p>
    <p>Through this task, I practiced using headings, paragraphs, and formatting tags. For example, I used <mark>highlighted text</mark> to emphasize important points and added a <small>small note</small> to show less important details. These skills will help me in future projects.</p>

    <!-- Part C: Text Formatting -->
        
    <p>My goal is to become a skilled <strong>web developer</strong> and build projects that solve real-world problems.<br>I am starting with <em> HTML basics</em> and will continue learning <mark>CSS</mark>, <mark>JavaScript</mark>, and beyond.</p>
